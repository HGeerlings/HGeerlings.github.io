</h3>

<p>
I was born in Santa Barbara, CA, on December 7th 1992 to Soli and Steve Geerlings. My K-12 education was performed within the Ventura Unified School District until I graduated from Foothill Technology Highschool in 2011. During my junior and senior years of highschool, I enrolled in community college courses in order to fulfill certain college breadth requirements. It was also during my senior year that I received the highschool's "Community Service Award" for volunteer work performed at Ventura City Corps, Aegis Assisted Living, and Project Understanding. 
</p>

<p>Upon graduating, I was accepted into engineering programs at SFSU and Colorado School of Mines. I instead attended Ventura College full-time and then transferred to Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, CA, for my second year. From DVC I was accepted into UC Berkeley's Materials Science and Engineering program for Fall 2013. Upon graduating from this program, I enrolled in a Materials Science M.S. program at Colorado School of Mines in Golden, where I currently live.
