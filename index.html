<p>My name is Henry Geerlings and I am currently enrolled in my final semester at UC Berkeley for a B.S. in Materials Science and Engineering (Dec. 2015). My academic focus has been centered around mechanical properties of materials and numerical methods for solving materials problems. Research that I have contributed to spans across several fronts; from atomistic simulations of dislocations in pure metals, to smart-search algorithms for inverse materials design, computation has always been at the forefront of the work I do.</p>

</h3>

<p>
I was born in Santa Barbara, CA, on December 7th 1992 to Soli and Steve Geerlings. My K-12 education was performed within the Ventura Unified School District until I graduated from Foothill Technology Highschool in 2011. During my junior and senior years of highschool, I enrolled in community college courses in order to fulfill certain college breadth requirements ahead of time. It was also during my senior year that I received the highschool's "Community Service Award" for volunteer work performed at Ventura City Corps, Aegis Assisted Living, and Project Understanding. 

Upon graduating, I was accepted into engineering programs at SFSU and Colorado School of Mines. I instead attended Ventura College full-time for just over one year and then transferred to Diablo Valley College in Pleasant Hill, CA, for my second year. From DVC I was accepted into UC Berkeley's Materials Science and Engineering program for Fall 2013.
